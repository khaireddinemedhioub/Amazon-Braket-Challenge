Optimization of single machine scheduling problems with sequence dependent setup times using QAOA

We implemented a variant of the TSP time dependant problem in the settings of industrial machine scheduling.
Our problem formulation as a QUBO was inspired from the formulation of a classical approach to this problem adressed in this paper https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1572528608000339?token=4190C333EE1D0417E28EF3B3CC381CCD11A0A07BFCB19BFFE5AA0A4BB4E853CE7193C38223950861C2B070FF56F70ADE&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220410140838
