Optimization of single machine scheduling problems with sequence dependent setup times using QAOA

We implemented a variant of the TSP time dependant problem in the settings of industrial machine scheduling.
Our problem formulation as a QUBO was inspired from the formulation of a classical approach to this problem adressed in this paper: https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1572528608000339?token=4190C333EE1D0417E28EF3B3CC381CCD11A0A07BFCB19BFFE5AA0A4BB4E853CE7193C38223950861C2B070FF56F70ADE&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220410140838

>Most of the research on scheduling problems has been done under the assumption that setup times are independent of job sequence
>In this paper, we consider single machine scheduling problems in sequence dependent setup environments and we
>exhibit how these problems present similarities with the time-dependent traveling salesman problem, a variant of the
>famous traveling salesman problem in which transition costs between two cities now depends on the time of the visit.
